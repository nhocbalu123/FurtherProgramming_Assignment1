# Insurance Claims Management System

## Description

The Insurance Claims Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage, track, and process insurance claims. The system is built around several key entities, including `Customer`, `InsuranceCard`, `Claim`, `Bank`, `DataManager`, `UI`, `PolicyHolder`, and `Dependent`.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete claims for customers.
- Display all customers and their claims.
- Save claim lists to a file.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.

## Usage

Run the `Main` class to start the application. The user interface will guide you through the available options:

1. Display all customers
2. Display all claims of a customer
3. Add a claim to a customer
4. Update a claim of a customer
5. Delete a claim of a customer
6. Exit

## Future Work

- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI) to make the system more user-friendly.
- Integrate a database for persistent data storage.
- Improve error handling and input validation.
- Allow users to choose the directory where files will be saved.
- Add options for users to sort customers or claims based on different attributes (like name, date, etc.) and in different orders (ascending or descending).
- Add additional features such as search functionality for claims and customers, and more detailed reports on claims status and processing times.
